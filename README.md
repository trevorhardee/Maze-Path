# Maze Run
Maze Run is a project that I worked on to gain a better understanding of React. 

Overall, this was a pleasant experience that taught me about the nuances of React while making a simple game.

### What is Maze Run?

This is a pathfinder project that includes a few features along with a maze game.

### Pathfinding

Click on the grid to place your path beginning and end. Select a search algorithm to find the path.

### Add Walls

Place walls that the path will have to go around by clicking and dragging the grid. Walls can be added after the beginning and end nodes have been chosen.

### Mazes

Click Draw Maze to draw a maze and find a path within the maze. You can remove walls by clicking them.

### Solve Maze

Finally, maneuver through the maze before time runs out. W, A, S and D represent up, left, down and right, respectively. Maneuver only if a maze has been drawn.
